# DamExhibitInfo

DAM Exhibit Info provides a CLI for users to find information about current and upcoming exhibits at the Denver Art Museum. The user will be initially asked to select current or upcoming exhibits in order to see more information about them. They will then be given a list of those exhibits with the name, dates they will be viewable, and short summary of each one. From there the user can then choose to see a detailed description of an exhibit.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dam_exhibit_info'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dam_exhibit_info

## Usage

After running the interface by entering the command dam_exhibit_info, simply follow the prompts and enter the appropriate information for your search.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
